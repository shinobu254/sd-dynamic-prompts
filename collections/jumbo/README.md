This is a pretty large set of modifiers and artists. It's a work in progress and will likely always be incomplete. Beware that Stable Diffusion may not be able to identify a proportion of the artists in the database. See this [issue](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts/issues/28) for a discussion. You can either use the collection as is, or use it as a way to bootstrap your own collection.
